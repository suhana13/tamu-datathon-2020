# Datathon Submission: For You
# Welcome to the repository for the For You Page! 
## Inspiration
We were inspired by the wealth of information provided by TAMU datathon and wanted to provide users and future competitors an easy way to access all of the available resources through a For You page. Machine learning algorithms and data science tools were used throughout this project - we hope that our learning process is able to be conveyed through this project and inspire future competitors!

## What it does
The user will log onto the page and will immediately be greeted by big picture visualizations of the other competitors' majors, classification and specific interests. Then, they are able to see their recommended 'dream' team based on clustering using parameters such as experience, university and age bracket. 
We also have built an NLP search engine that outputs workshops based on user-inputted text/keywords by checking the words' relation to specific workshop 'tags' based on a logistic regression model.
This contains notebooks used for each of the clustering/visualization/preprocessing tasks.
